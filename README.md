#  Password Manager (Python + Tkinter)

A GUI-based password manager built with Python’s `tkinter`. It allows users to generate, save, and manage credentials (website, email, and password) securely in a local JSON file.

##  Features
- **Graphical Interface (Tkinter)**  
  User-friendly GUI with input fields for website, email/username, and password.

- **Password Generator**  
  Built-in random password generator for strong, secure passwords.

- **Save to JSON File**  
  Credentials (website, email, password) are stored in a structured JSON file for persistence.

- **Search Functionality**  
  Quickly retrieve saved credentials by entering the website name.

- **Error Handling**  
  Input validation ensures no empty fields before saving.

##  What I Learned
- Building GUIs with `tkinter`  
- Handling user input and events  
- Working with JSON for data storage and retrieval  
- Designing interactive applications with modular logic

##  How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ochuba1001/password-manager-gui.git
   cd password-manager-
2. Run the app:
   `bash
   python main.py
   `
3. Use the GUI to:
   - Enter website, email, and password  
   - Generate a random password if needed  
   - Save credentials to a JSON file  
   - Search for saved credentials by website

#  Sample Workflow
1. Enter website, email, and password in the GUI fields.  
2. Click Generate Password for a secure random password.  
3. Click Save to store credentials in data.json.  
4. Use Search to retrieve saved login details.

#  Future Improvements
- Encrypt stored passwords for added security  
- Implement categories/tags for organizing credentials  
- Build a more modern GUI with customtkinter
